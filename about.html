        <p>
            Hi, I am Chen. I came from Shanghai and currently live in Melbourne Australia with my husband and a
            miniature dachshund. I have a master's degree in engineering and a background in technology. I am passionate about building innovative and socially responsible software and to inspire others to
            cultivate joy, fluidity and mindfulness in their yoga practice and everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been practising yoga since the late nineties and was fortunate to be instructed by many international yoga teachers in different styles.
          Personally I have deeply benefited from yoga and meditation while managing chronic pain and health conditions.
          I have also seen other people's remarkable healing through the practice of yoga.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being Chinese, I am inspired by the <a href="yinyoga.html">Yin Yoga</a> philosophy and physical practice that is based on Daoism and the Chinese Traditional Medicine meridian system.
            At the same time, coming from a technical background, I am fascinated by neuroscience and anatomy which provides the foundation for
            Yin Yoga practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            I see the practice of yoga is a readily accessible means toward greater self-awareness, sustained concentration
            and improved flexibility and freedom of the body, which in turn leads to improved flexibility and freedom of the mind.
        </p>
        <div id="round-photo"></div>
        <p>
            My motivation for teaching Yin Yoga is to share the benefits and
            learnings from the practice I gained on my own healing journey with others. I plan the sequence for every class
            with a strong and considered focus, and endeavour to clearly communicate physiological and energetic benefits
            to the students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through a variety of poses, and conscious sequencing, my classes honour the different needs of individuals,
            and are designed to calm the nervous system and build flexibility and balance by providing space for students
            to develop confidence and wisdom of their own bodies.
