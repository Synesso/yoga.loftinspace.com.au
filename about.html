        <p>
            Hi, I am Chen. I came from Shanghai and currently live in Melbourne Australia with my husband and a
            miniature dachshund. I have a master's degree in engineering and a background in technology finance.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been practising yoga since the late nineties. Personally I have deeply benefited from yoga and
            meditation while managing chronic pain and health conditions. I have also seen other people's
            remarkable healing through the practice of Yin yoga. Being Chinese, I am inspired by the Yin Yoga philosophy
            and physical practice that is based on Taoism and the Chinese Traditional Medicine meridian system. At the
            same time, I am fascinated by neuroscience and anatomy because of my technical background.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about building innovative and socially responsible software and to inspire others to
            cultivate joy, peace and mindfulness in their yoga practice and everyday life.  I see the practice of yoga
            is to free the body of restrictions, which in turn releases the mind from conditioning. My motivation for
            teaching Yin Yoga is to share the benefits and learnings from the practice I gained on my own healing
            journey with others, and to build a community of like-minded people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through a variety of poses, and conscious sequencing, my classes honour the different needs of individuals
            and are intended to calm the autonomic nervous system, and build flexibility and balance by providing space
            to students for developing confidence, and wisdom of their own bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
            My commitment is to honour the differences and needs in every individual.
