        <header>What is Yin Yoga?</header>
        <p>
            Yin yoga is a practice of deep opening of the body, founded and first taught in the US by
            martial arts expert and Taoist yoga teacher Paulie Zink.
            It releases deep held tension, optimises bone health and increases flexibility, especially in the joints of the hips and spine.
            Yin practice is a journey that takes us inwards. We work with connective tissues, such as ligaments that wrap around our joints
            and the web of fascia that connects all the bones, joints, muscles and organs in our bodies.
            It is a quiet practice that calms our nervous system and provides a wonderful balance to our busy lifestyle.
            Guided by the sensations of their own body, individual practitioners can take each pose to their own edge,
            and make the practice a deeply calming, nourishing and meditative experience.

    <section id="how">
        <header>How is the class conducted?</header>
        <p>Each class starts with a brief series of movements to mobilise the spine and joints throughout the body,
           followed by Yin floor postures sequenced with a focus, such as a flow for the spine or a flow to stimulate the energy
           for the liver meridian, and ends with Shavasana (deep relaxation).</p>
